# Agent Instructions

When editing files under `Configuration/`:
- Read `Configuration/VISION.md` first and keep changes aligned with that vision.
- Preserve the model where presets batch-write collapsibles and collapsibles remain source-of-truth.
- Keep logging controls boolean-only: `Basic Logs`, `Diagnostics Logs`, `Verbose Logs`.
