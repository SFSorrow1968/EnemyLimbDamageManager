# Agent Instructions

When editing files under `Core/`:
- Read `Core/VISION.md` first and keep changes aligned with that vision.
- Preserve deterministic state transitions and structured logging for injury, KO, mock death, revive, and death behavior.
- If the change affects runtime sound behavior, also follow `_docs/SOUND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.
